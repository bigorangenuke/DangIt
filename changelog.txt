=== ALPHA 3.2 ===

Code changes to have a persistent scenario module as runtime controller.


=== ALPHA 3.1 ===

Partial FAR compatibility.
Fixed (?) the issue with RAPIER engines.
Exponential decay of the recovery value of a part.


=== ALPHA 3 ===

Big Stuff:
 - EVA Inspection: you can now inspect a part while on EVA to have a ballpark estimate of its reliability (currently hideous, will embellish asap);
 - Inpsection bonus: additionally, performing an inspection will give a temporary reliability boost to the part;
 - Preemptive maintenance: you can now permanently improve the reliability (by consuming spare parts);
 - The higher a part's temperature, the faster it will age: be careful with those reentry angles!

Small stuff:
 - Now all the reliability infos are in their own panel in the editor;
 - Added support for engines that use ModuleEngineFX: now all engines should be covered, at least in theory;

Fixes:
 - Timewarp now stops when a failure occurs;
 - Resource leaks can't be stopped by shutting the valves;
 - The kerbal's name is now displayed correctly during EVA events
 - A bug that caused leaks to show incorrectly in the flight log
 - The formatting of the flight log messages.




=== ALPHA 2.2 ===

Added:
- Now failures are repairs are listed in the Flight Events log
- Master settings file: located in DangIt\PluginData\DangIt\DangIt.cfg (don't move it). Contains the leak blacklist and also 3 master switches to enable / disable messages and the red glow (and a placeholder for sounds). This file is reloaded at each flight scene. Silent failures will not display any notification even when the master is enabled. 

Fixed:
- the persistency of failures: now they should be loaded correctly between saves.
- the leak blacklist. Now it actually works.
- the lights on landing gear now fail correctly.
- the GUI of reaction wheels is now hidden when the wheel fails.
- new reliability buff for everything (+100% MTBF: I laughed at 343 for buffing the warthog by 30%)

Changed:
- small changed in the API regarding how failures are handled. I guess it doesn't really matter since I'm the only one using the API anyway.

=== ALPHA 2.1 ===

Added the black list for leaking tanks. Now you can prevent a resource from leaking by adding a field in the cfg file as:
    ignore = <resourcename>
    
Huge buff for all the reliability values.

=== ALPHA 2 ===

Big stuff:
    - Completely redone how the persistence and update logic is handled: now it should actually do what it is supposed to!*
    - Kerbals now receive a random discount on the cost of repairing a failed part: the lower the stupidity, the higher the possible discount.
    - Introduced silent failures: if a failure is silent, you will get no notification when it happens and the part won't light up.
    - You now have the possibility to initiate the failures manually: this of course won't be in the final version, but this way you can test it and give me feedback.
    
Small stuff:
    - Control surfaces now only age in atmosphere.
    - Removed the AgeOnlyWhenActive flag
    - Fixed the bug that caused parts not updating unless they were in the active stage
    - Drastic changes in the cfgs' values
    - various bug-fixes and a lot of logging changes that don't really matter to you

*... probably




=== ALPHA 1, revision 3 ===

The control surfaces now age when the ship is in atmosphere instead of always.
Fixed the tanks not leaking correctly

=== ALPHA 1, revision 2 ===

Fixed (?) the lifecycle of the module with proper initialization when the flight starts (and detecting a revert to launch).
Fixed the part's glow not turning off.

=== ALPHA 1 ===

Initial release
